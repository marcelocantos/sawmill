# 🎯T191 — rebuild + restart the daily jevonsd on :13705.
#
# Purpose: overseer/PO/worker bounce after daemon-path Build without asking
# the owner to restart by hand (🎯T188). Session death must not cancel the
# bounce — invoke this script *detached* (see BLESSED INVOKE below).
#
# Steps:
#   1. make / rebuild bin/jevonsd
#   2. decide whether a restart is needed at all (🎯T218 thrash policy below)
#   3. brew services stop jevons (so Cellar KeepAlive cannot reclaim :13705)
#   4. kill listeners on the daily port
#   5. start $REPO/bin/jevonsd with workdir set (detached: nohup/setsid)
#   6. wait until HTTP /health is ok and /api/frontier is not 404
#   7. exit 0 only when the new process is serving
#
# 🎯T218 THRASH POLICY — why this script often does nothing, on purpose.
#
# Many fleet workers land daemon-path changes concurrently and each calls
# this script. Naively that SIGTERMs :13705 every minute and leaves owner
# chat unusable. Observed 2026-08-05: five restarts in four minutes, every
# one of them rebuilding nothing ("make: `bin/jevonsd' is up to date") —
# a healthy daemon killed and replaced by the byte-identical binary.
#
# Three rules bound that, without ever letting a real change go stale
# (🎯T194 says a daemon change is not achieved until it actually serves):
#
#   ALREADY-ACTIVATED — if the freshly built binary hashes equal to the one
#     the running daemon was started from, and that daemon is healthy, there
#     is nothing to activate. Exit 0 without touching the port. This is a
#     true no-op, not a deferral: the daily path already serves this exact
#     build, so the caller's activation claim is honest.
#
#   ONE-AT-A-TIME — a lock dir serialises restarts. Concurrent callers wait
#     for the holder instead of racing to kill the same port, then re-run the
#     ALREADY-ACTIVATED check. N workers landing the same build coalesce into
#     a single bounce.
#
#   WAIT, DON'T SKIP — when the binary genuinely differs but the last restart
#     was under MIN_INTERVAL_SEC ago, sleep out the remainder and then restart.
#     Never silently skip a real change: a skip would report success while a
#     stale binary kept serving, which is exactly the 🎯T194 failure mode.
#
# So: identical build → free no-op; new build → always activated, at most
# one bounce per MIN_INTERVAL_SEC. --force overrides all three (owner debug).
#
# BLESSED INVOKE (fleet agent / overseer — survive parent death):
#   nohup "$REPO/scripts/restart-daily-jevonsd.sh" \
#     >>"$HOME/.jevons/restart-daily.log" 2>&1 &
# Prefer nohup (portable). If setsid is available:
#   setsid "$REPO/scripts/restart-daily-jevonsd.sh" \
#     >>"$HOME/.jevons/restart-daily.log" 2>&1 < /dev/null &
#
# NEVER run this script as a foreground child of a fleet agent without
# detach. Agent SIGHUP/SIGTERM will kill the bounce mid-flight and leave
# the owner on a dead or stale binary. The daemon itself is also started
# under nohup/setsid so it outlives this script (reparented to init).

Usage: restart-daily-jevonsd.sh [options]

Rebuild bin/jevonsd, stop brew KeepAlive if needed, free the daily port,
start repo bin/jevonsd detached, wait until /health and /api/frontier serve.

🎯T218 thrash policy: if the rebuilt binary is already the one the running
daemon is serving, this exits 0 without touching the port (already
activated). Concurrent callers serialise on a lock and coalesce. A binary
that genuinely changed always gets activated — if the last restart was
inside the min-interval, the script waits out the remainder rather than
skipping, so a real change never reports success while a stale binary serves.

Options:
  -h, --help     Show this help and exit 0
  --dry-run      Print planned steps; do not stop/start/kill
  --force        Bypass the thrash policy: restart even if the running
                 daemon already serves this build, and do not wait out the
                 min-interval. Owner-debug escape hatch — fleet agents
                 should not use it, since an unchanged binary needs no
                 bounce and a changed one is activated without it (🎯T218).

  JEVONS_RESTART_PORT              Listen port (default 13705)
  JEVONS_RESTART_WORKDIR           -workdir for jevonsd (default: repo root)

  JEVONS_RESTART_STAMP             Stamp file for last success (default ~/.jevons/restart-daily.last)
